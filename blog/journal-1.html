              The 1970s were, arguably, a culmination one of the most inventive
              eras in French and Italian design. It’s a decade that saw the
              liberation of design where older rules were ignored. Unorthodox
              space age and new designs loosened the stiff conventions of
              mid-century modernism and a new glamour was born. These iconic
              designers have left a legacy and their designs are very much in
              demand today and are highly collectable. Their value remains
              stable and would be considered good investments. Pierre Paulin,
              whose ’Mushroom’, ’Orange Slice’, ’Tongue’ and ’Ribbon’ chairs
              have become part of the contemporary furniture canon are a prime
              example of this new trend.

              The freshness and modernity of his designs likely encouraged the
              collaboration between Paulin and the Mobilier National, the
              government agency overseeing the French national furniture
              collection. This in turn prompted President Georges Pompidou and
              his wife, to enlist his services in remodelling the private
              apartment of the Élysée Palace. These designs possibly resisted
              ageing because they are so comfortable-he has created seating that
              makes you feel good. In fact at the moment his designs are having
              a Renaissance.

              There are mythical creatures that haunt the design imagination of
              the 1960’s and 1970’s. Partly because of her stature and beauty
              Gabriela Crespi stands out amongst the designers. Gabriela
              Crespi’s early objects were commissioned by the fashion giant Dior
              for their gifts department. Her design pieces have been
              appreciated and owned by public figures such as King Faisal, the
              Shah Reza Pahlavi, Grace Kelly,George Livanos, Thomas Hoving,
              Audrey Hepburn, Gunter Sachs. They are highly collectable today.
              Between 1972 and 1975, she designed the “Quick Change Sofa”, the
              “Z” line ( “Z Bar,” “Z Desk” ) and the “Rising Sun” bamboo
              collection, one of the pioneers material much loved by Crespi. The
              famous “Fungo” lamps (1973) are part of this collection.

              <b>Willy Rizzo</b> was uniquely placed as a designer for the Dolce Vita,
              being himself a part of the world for which he was designing.
              Salvador Dalí commissioned a number of pieces, as did Brigitte
              Bardot for the interior of La Madrague in St. Tropez. By 1968,
              Willy's work was in constant demand, leading to the setting up of
              his own firm and the establishment of a factory just outside Rome
              at Tivoli. Over the following ten years, Rizzo designed and
              produced more than thirty pieces of furniture, including the
              famous steel-banded travertine dining tables and bronze table
              lamps, all of which were handmade. He opened boutiques across
              France and Europe and had points of sale in New York City, Miami
              and Los Angeles. However, in 1978, Rizzo gave it all up to return
              to photography, his first love. Today his Elliptical marble table
              is exhibited at MoMA in New York. Among Rizzo's most successful
              designs are many low, box-like tables in granite, metal, glass, or
              burled wood, often embellished with brass or chrome accents or
              built-in liquor cabinets or traysTwo examples of his most
              celebrated designs include the Alveo Coffee Table (1970s) for
              Mario Sabot and the circular Yin Yang Coffee Table (1970s).

              <b>Ettore Sottsass</b> wan an architect and designer. He was labeled the
              godfather of Italian design. Fashioned from slick, vacuum-moulded
              plastic and cast fiberglass, it was part of the brand’s mission to
              bring novel industrial materials—which had already revolutionised
              nautical and automobile design—into the home. The radical range
              was produced in a very limited edition, with one exception: the
              neon-lit pink mirror called Ultrafragola, or “the ultimate
              strawberry.” A widely circulated image on social media this mirror
              is highly collectible now days. It celebrated femininity—the
              curves of a woman’s body; the waves of her hair. Women the world
              over have embraced the mirror, still made using the original 1970
              mould.

              <b>Maison Jansen</b> is another design studio that in the 1970's produced
              one of my favourite set of collectables of all times. They were
              produced in brass gold in France or in Italy and demonstrated
              glitz and luxury which was very much a reminder of old Hollywood
              glamour. They became very popular with the international jetset.
              One of the line of furniture that they produced was signed by
              Alain Delon. The history of Maison Jansen is very rich since it
              was the first international interior design firm that was founded
              in 1880 in Rue Royale in Paris. The founder Jean Henri Jansen was
              the first so called "dealer" to carry everything necessary to
              furnish a home. Customers include Duke and Duchess of Windsor,
              Agnelli’s, C.Z Guest and Jackie Kennedy worked with them to
              remodel several rooms in the White House. Their furniture and
              objets d'art are very much in demand and highly collectable
            </p>

              <b>Maria Pergay</b> is best known for her unique use of stainless steel
              in producing tables, belt buckles, decorative artefacts, chairs,
              and daybeds. Pergay’s pieces often feature organic shapes such as
              waves, rings, and shells.Over the years, Pergay has continued to
              create for her own pleasure, exhibiting and selling to clients and
              quietly obtaining impressive private commissions for names such as
              Givenchy, the Shah of Iran, Pierre Cardin, Fendi, Christian Dior,
              Jacques Heim and Salvador Dalí. Today her work can be found in the
              permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York,
              and is displayed in private collections around the world. Pergay,
              who has never belonged to a distinct design movement, is a mother
              of four with no formal training in furniture design or external
              financial support. Instead of following trends, she has
              consistently drawn inspiration from antiquity, Japanese art, and
              the innate nature of the materials she works with. While this
              individual approach may have meant that many of her pieces did not
              receive recognition until years after they were created, it has
              ensured that her work has stood the test of time.
